Electromyography (EMG) is a diagnostic procedure to assess the health of muscles and the nerve cells that control them (motor neurons). EMG results can reveal nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction or problems with nerve-to-muscle signal transmission.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent:2em"><font face="Arial" color = "black" size="4" style="line-height: 1.1">
B&L Engineering manufactures active surface EMG pre-amplified electrodes compatible with most EMG Systems. There are three models to choose from: Wide-spaced electrode pads with an integrated ground pad and wide or narrow spaced electrode pads for use with a separate ground. No skin preparation or gel is required, and both screw spring and thumb screw adaptors are available for Fine Wire attachment. The electrodes and connectors are color coordinated in eight different colors for ease of use.</font></p>

Textile electromyography (EMG) electrodes embedded in clothing allow muscle excitation to be recorded in previously inaccessible settings; however, their ability to accurately and reliably measure EMG during dynamic tasks remains largely unexplored.</font></p>
