In-shoe pressure measurement devices are commonly used in both research and clinical settings to quantify contact area and pressure on the plantar surface of the foot when wearing a shoe. The devices enable the measurement and comparison of pressure in cases of diseases such as diabetes, and the evaluation of footwear or orthotics designed to modify plantar pressures. Various devices are available, which differ in size, sensor number, sensor type and therefore their response to loading and their accuracy. The strengths and weaknesses of each system in terms of validity and repeatability influence the appropriateness of each device for specific tasks in both clinical and research settings. Now we have one pair of Footswitches insole sensors (B&L Engineering, Inc.), two pair of pressure insole sensors (Podoon, Inc., Moticon, Inc.).

A wearable gait observation system is being developed in the form of autonomous insoles that can collect sensor data throughout the day. Each insole comprises pressure sensors for studying posture. These pressure sensors are off the shelf components that are integrated in flexible insoles for using easily in daily life. A commercially available Smartphone is used to wirelessly collect data in real time from the insoles and transfers it to a backend computer server via microcontroller. Transfer of sensor data from the insoles to the Smartphone is implemented using the Bluetooth Low Energy wireless standard.</font></p>
